# Best Practices of a Microservice Architecture with Spring Cloud, React, CI, CD and IaC

This repository is Dealer Management Systems based on a microservices architecture.

The architecture supports the following technologies: 

  * Frameworks - Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Feign, Eureka, Resilience4j.
  * UI - React Native or React Native Web to build as a mobile app or hybrid app (web + mobile)
  * Firebase, AWS Amplify, or Hasura (using GraphQL subscriptions) to send messages in realtime
  * Cloudinary or Firebase storage for sending messages with image or video content
  * Serverless functions like AWS Lambda or Firebase Functions for notifications
  * Cloudinary or Firebase storage for uploading pictures or video
  * Algolia for lightning-fast vehicle searching
  * Databases - H2, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MongoDB
  * API Management : Spring REST Docs, Swagger
  * Security: JWT (JSON Web Token) with OIDC, OpenID Connect with MITREid Connect, OAuth 2.0,  “UAA” (User Account and Authentication) server.
  * Message brokers - Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, and Redis Streams
  * Services communicate asynchronously using domain events, and command/reply messages.
  * Cloud - AWS, Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF), Google Compute Platform (GCP), OpenStack, VMware vSphere,  Heroku, Netlify
  * Server Side - Spring Boot, Spring Security, Maven, Hibernate, Liquibase, Cucumber, ArchUnit, Gatling, Elasticsearch, Kafka, Elastic Stack, Prometheus
  * Client Side - HTML5, Bootstrap, TypeScript, Angular, React.
  * CI / CD - Jenkins, Travis CI, Github Workflows, Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Minikube, Minishift, OpenShift, Jenkins X, KOTS, ECS (Elastic Container Service), EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

# The Key Requirements

  * Maximize team autonomy.
  * Optimize for development speed.
  * Focus on automation (Automate everything).
  * Provide flexibility without compromising consistency.
  * Built for resilience.
  * Simplified maintenance.
  * Application portability.
  * Application auto-scaling.
  * Centralized platform administration.
  * Centralized logging.
  * Dynamic routing.
  * Application health management.
  * Integration with external logging components like Elasticsearch and Logstash.
  * Role-based access for deployed applications.
  * Provision for vertical and horizontal scaling.
  * Infrastructure security.
  * Support for various IaaS providers.

# Twelve-factor application guide
1.  **Codebase** One codebase tracked in VCS, many deploys. One app has a single code base and its tracked by a version control system like Git, Subversion, Mercurial, etc. You can do many deployments (from the same code base) to development, testing, staging and production environments.

2.  **Dependencies**. Explicity declare and isolate dependencies. Some times your environments don’t have internect connection (if is a private system), so you need to think about packaging your dependencies (jars, gems, shared-libraries, etc) or if you have an internal repository of libraries, you can declared manifest like poms, gemfile, bundles, etc. Never rely that you will have everything in your final environment.

3.  **Configuration**. Store config in the environment. You should’t hardcode anything that varies. Use the environment variables or a configuration server.

4. **Backing Services** Treat backing services as attached resources. Connect to services via URL or configuration.

5.  **Build, Release, Run** Strictly separate build and run stages. Related to a CI/CD (Continuous Integration, Continuous Delivery)

6.  **Processes** Execute the app as one or more stateless processes. Processess should not store internal state. Share nothing. Any necessary state should be considered as a Backing Service.

7.  **Port binding** Export services via port port binding. Your application is self-container, and these apps are exposed via port binding. An application can become another App’ service.

8.  **Concurrency** Scale out via the process model. Scale by adding more application instances. Individual processes are free to multithread.

9.  **Disposability** Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown. Processes should be disposable (remember they are stateless). Fault tolerant.

10.  **Environment** parity. Keep development, staging and production environments as similar as possible. This is a result of High Quality, ensures continuous delivery.

11. **Logs** Treat logs as event streams. Your apps should write to stdout. Logs are streams of aggregated, time-ordered events.

12. **Admin processes** Run admin and managemenr tasks as one-off processes. Run admin processes on the platform: DB migrations, one time scripts, etc.

# Architecture

The following diagram shows the targert platform architecture.:

![Targert platform architecture](/docs/images/Targert-platform-architecture.png)

Since an auto dealership application uses the Microservice architecture pattern for vehicle details data is spread over multiple services. For example,

- Vehicle Service - basic information about the vehicle
- Transaction service - purchase history for vehicle, vehicle price
- Dealership service - vehicle availability,Order processing, stock

Consequently, the code that displays the vehicle details needs to fetch information from all of these services.

Each service is:

* :small_orange_diamond: **Highly maintainable and testable** enables rapid and frequent development and deployment.

* :small_orange_diamond: Loosely coupled with other services - enables a team to work independently the majority of time on their service(s) without being impacted by changes to other services and without affecting other services.

* :small_orange_diamond: Independently deployable - enables a team to deploy their service without having to coordinate with other teams 

* :small_orange_diamond: Capable of being developed by a small team - essential for high productivity by avoiding the high communication head of large teams. 

* :small_orange_diamond: Services communicate using either synchronous protocols such as HTTP/REST or asynchronous protocols such as AMQP. 
* :small_orange_diamond: Services can be developed and deployed independently of one another. 

* :small_orange_diamond: Each service has its own database in order to be decoupled from other services. 

* :small_orange_diamond: Data consistency between services is maintained using the Saga pattern. 

* :small_orange_diamond: Client-side Discovery pattern or Server-side Discovery pattern to route requests to available service instances. 

* :small_orange_diamond: The API Gateway authenticate the user and pass an Access Token containing information about the user to the services 

* :small_orange_diamond: API Gateway  use a Circuit Breaker to invoke services :small_orange_diamond: API gateway often implements the API Composition pattern. 

* :small_orange_diamond: Asynchronous Java API + Reactive Programming Model. 

* :small_orange_diamond: Hystrix Fault Tolerance.

# Using patterns

- Service Discovery & Service Registry : Eureka
- Load balancing : Spring Cloud Loadbalancer
- Reliability Circuit-breaking  and Fault-tolerance  :  Resilience4j, Istio, Service Mesh.
- API Gateway 	: Spring Cloud Gateway
- Externalized configuration  : Spring Cloud Config
- Failure- and latency-aware, load balancing, Cluster failover and Retry
- Distributed tracing : Spring Cloud Sleuth.
- Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters Pattern)
- Consumer Driven Contract : Spring Cloud Contract.
- Security : Access Token with Okta, Spring Cloud Security

  - Log aggregation : AWS Cloud Watch
  - Application metrics - instrument a service’s code to gather statistics about operations
  - Audit logging - record user activity in a database
  - Distributed tracing - Zipkin, Sleuth and ELK Stack
  - Exception tracking - Sentry, TrackJS, Raygun and Airbrake.
  - Health check API : EurekaClient, Spring Boot Admin and Spring Boot Actuator
  - Log deployments and changes : GitHub, AWS CloudTrail and LogDNA.

  - Service instance per Container - Dockerfile and DockerComposite
  - Serverless deployment - deploy a service using serverless deployment platform
  - Service deployment platform - deploy services using a highly automated deployment platform that provides a service abstraction
- Transactional messaging:
- Data management : 
  - Database per Service - each service has its own private database
  - Domain event - publish an event whenever data changes
  - Event sourcing - persist aggregates as a sequence of events


## Building and running the application

This is a Maven project. However, you  need to have installed :
  - Java Development Kit >= 11
  - React "^16.13.1"
  - Docker
  - Maven
  - Kubernates CLI
  - Minikube
  - Minishift

  - IaaS (Infrastructure as a service)
  - PaaS (Platform as a Service)
  - Local

## Building and running using SaaS

First, must sign up to get your credentials in order to get free access to the SaaS version.

# Important endpoints

Run locally with Maven, Visual Studio Code, STS, Eclipse or IntelliJ:

:point_right: Gateway http://localhost:8080  
:point_right: Eureka Discovery Dashboard http://localhost:8761  
:point_right: Config Server http://localhost:7761  
:point_right: Spring Admin Dashboard http://localhost:9761  
:point_right: Vehicle service http://localhost:8081  
:point_right: Dealership service http://localhost:8082  
:point_right: Transaction service http://localhost:8083  
:point_right: RabbitMq (username/password: guest/guest) http://localhost:15000 



Run with docker-compose:

:point_right: Gateway http://localhost:5080  
:point_right: Eureka Discovery Dashboard http://localhost:5761  
:point_right: Config Server http://localhost:5760  
:point_right: Spring Admin Dashboard http://localhost:5761  
:point_right: Vehicle service http://localhost:5081  
:point_right: Dealership service http://localhost:5082  
:point_right: Transaction service http://localhost:5083  
:point_right: RabbitMq (username/password: guest/guest) http://localhost:15000 


## Spring Cloud Config Server

Spring Cloud Config Server offers the following benefits:

- HTTP resource-based API for external configuration (name-value pairs or equivalent YAML content)

- Encrypt and decrypt property values (symmetric or asymmetric)

- Embeddable easily in a Spring Boot application using @EnableConfigServer

## Spring Cloud Config Client

Spring Cloud Config Client lets you:

- Bind to the Config Server and initialize Spring Environment with remote property sources.

- Encrypt and decrypt property values (symmetric or asymmetric).

- @RefreshScope for Spring @Beans that want to be re-initialized when configuration changes.

Use management endpoints:

  - /env for updating Environment and rebinding @ConfigurationProperties and log levels.
  - /refresh for refreshing the @RefreshScope beans.
  - /restart for restarting the Spring context (disabled by default).
  - /pause and /resume for calling the Lifecycle methods (stop() and start() on the ApplicationContext).

Bootstrap application context: It binds to the Config Server and decrypts property values.

## Using the Swagger UI

The services are Swagger "enabled".

Open the url http://${DOCKER_HOST_IP}:<SERVICE-PORT>/swagger-ui.html

All Swagger Resources(groups) : http://localhost:<SERVICE-PORT>/swagger-resources
